#These lists are actually extracted from a bigger dataset file of world development indicators from the World Bank. 
#For pedagogical purposes, we have pre-processed this dataset into the lists that you'll be working with.


# Zip lists: zipped_lists
zipped_lists = zip(feature_names,row_vals)

# Create a dictionary: rs_dict
rs_dict = dict(zipped_lists)

# Print the dictionary
print(rs_dict)
